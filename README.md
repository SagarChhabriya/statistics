## Introduction to Statistics
1. [Chapter 1](#chapter-1)
   Summary Statistics
    - What is stats?
    - Descriptive vs inferential stats
    - Measures of center
    - Measures of spread
2. [Chapter-2](#chapter-2)
  Probability and Distributions
    - What are the chances
    - Conditional Probability
    - Discrete Distributions
    - Continuous Distributions


## Chapter-1
- What is statistics: The practice and study of collecting and analyzing data.
- Two main branches of statistics
  - Descriptice/summary statistics: describing or summarizing our data
  - Inferential statistics: collect a sample of data, and apply the results to the population that the sample represents.

- What statistics can do?
    - Allows us to answer practical questions:
      - What is the average salary in the USA?
      - How many customer inquires is a company likely to receive per week?

    - It has applications across society:
        - Developing safer products such as cars or airplanes
        - Help governements understand the needs of a population

- Limitations of Statistics
    - Statistics requires specific, measurable questions:
        - Is rock mucs more popular than jazz?
        - On average, do women live longer than man?
    - We can's use stats to find out **why** relationships exist.

#### Types of data
- Numerical: Continuous | Interval/count
- Categorical: Nominal  | Oridnal


#### Descriptive vs Inferential 
- Descriptive stats describes or summarize data
- Inferential stats usa a sample to draw conclusions about population (How many people purchase clothing following social media?)



## Measuers of Center

|Name | Description|
|-----|----------------------------------------|
|Mean | sum of all values / count of all values|
|Median|Middle value |
|Mode| Most frequest value|
|Visualization| Histograms, KDE (kernel density estimation) plots|


## Measures of spread
|Name| Description|
|----|------------|
|Range|maximum - minimum|
|Variance|value - mean|
|Standard Deviation|âˆšvariance|
|Quartiles|Splitting the data into four equal parts|
|Interquartile Range (IQR)| 3rd Quratile - 1st Quartile|
|Visualizations|Boxplot|

Standard deviation close to zero = data clustered around the mean

#### Independent Probability
Two events are **independent** if the probability of the second event **does not** change based on the outcome of the first event.
