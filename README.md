## Chapter-1

- Two main branches of statistics

- Categorical: Nominal  | Oridnal


#### Descriptive vs Inferential

## Measuers of Center

|Name | Description|
|-----|----------------------------------------|
|Mean | sum of all values / count of all values|
|Median|Middle value |
|Mode| Most frequest value|
|Visualization| Histograms, KDE (kernel density estimation) plots|


## Measures of spread
|Name| Description|
|----|------------|
|Range|maximum - minimum|
|Variance|value - mean|
|Standard Deviation|âˆšvariance|
|Quartiles|Splitting the data into four equal parts|
|Interquartile Range (IQR)| 3rd Quratile - 1st Quartile|
|Visualizations|Boxplot|

Standard deviation close to zero = data clustered around the mean
